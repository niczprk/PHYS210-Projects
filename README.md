PHYS210-Projects 

Code and visualizations of three major projects associated with the UBC course Phys210.

The first project (Project01) is an exercise in kinematics and mass loss. Two ice balls are released into a contained room at set velocities and with each collision chunks of ice are lost, depending on the initial mass of the ice ball.

The second project is a saturnian 3D electron orbit stability simulation. Use of one central proton grouping and 3 outer electrons was used with the goal of trying to find an area of instability for the 3rd outermost electron in the system by varying the (x,y,z) parameters and initial (Vx,Vy,Vz) velocities. This project employed the use of MPL toolkits and Solve_IVP in order to graph the position of the particles over a chosen amount of "stable" time.

The third project is an ideal nuclear reactor multplication factor simulation. Using a very simple nuclear reaction model initial paramters were modified to add both a neutron moderator and substance purity variable. This was done with an objective of using simulations to find the ideal conditions of mean free path and material purity to stbailize the multiplcation factor at a value of 1.0, a stable reaction. Visualizations were done using histograms, 3D mesh plots and an interactive 2D contour plot.
